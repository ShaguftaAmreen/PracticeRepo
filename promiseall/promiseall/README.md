# React Promise.all Example

This React app demonstrates fetching data from two APIs using `Promise.all()` and Axios:
1. Fetches users from `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`.
2. Fetches posts from `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`.

Both requests are made concurrently, and data is displayed:
- User names are shown in a list.
- Post IDs are displayed in a heading.

## Installation
